# 🎯 Passive Listening Updates

**Date:** October 8, 2025, 11:05 AM  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed & Enhanced

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Suggestion Click Not Working ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** When clicking the AI suggestion box, nothing happened.

**Root Cause:** The click handler was trying to read `input.value` at click time, but by then the user might have already sent the message or cleared the input.

**Solution:** Capture and store the text when the suggestion is created, then use that stored text when clicked.

```javascript
// OLD (broken):
suggestionDiv.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (input.value.trim()) {  // ❌ Input might be empty now
        handleAICommand(`/ai ${input.value.trim()}`);
    }
});

// NEW (working):
const capturedText = text;  // ✅ Store text when suggestion created
suggestionDiv.addEventListener('click', () => {
    handleAICommand(`/ai ${capturedText}`);  // ✅ Always use captured text
});
```

---

### Issue 2: Auto-Translate Not Working ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Passive listening didn't detect translation requests or foreign languages.

**Solution:** Added multiple detection mechanisms:

1. **Translation Keywords Detection:**
   - Detects: `translate`, `translation`, `traduce`, `traduire`, `übersetzen`
   - Detects: `mean in`, `how do you say`, `what does X mean`, `como se dice`

2. **Foreign Language Detection:**
   - Detects non-ASCII characters (Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.)
   - Only triggers if text is 10+ characters (avoids false positives)

3. **Smart Suggestion Messages:**
   - Translation request → 🌐 "Need help with translation?"
   - Foreign language → 🌐 "Would you like me to translate or help with this?"
   - Question → 💡 "I can help answer that question!"
   - Help keywords → 💡 "Would you like me to help with that?"

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Detection Logic

```javascript
// Question detection
const isQuestion = text.endsWith('?');

// Help keywords
const hasHelpKeywords = /\b(help|how|what|where|when|why|who|can you|could you|please|advice|tip|suggest)\b/i.test(text);

// Translation keywords
const hasTranslateKeywords = /\b(translate|translation|traduce|traduire|übersetzen|mean in|how do you say|what does.*mean|como se dice)\b/i.test(text);

// Foreign language detection
const hasNonAscii = /[^\x00-\x7F]/.test(text);
const likelyForeignLanguage = hasNonAscii && text.length > 10;
```

### Trigger Priority
1. **Translation keywords** (highest priority - explicit request)
2. **Foreign language** (high priority - clear need)
3. **Questions** (medium priority)
4. **Help keywords** (medium priority)

### Rate Limiting
- Max 1 suggestion per 30 seconds
- Prevents spam
- Tracks via `lastSuggestedHelp` timestamp
