## 🆕 New Features Added

### 1. 🌐 **Clarify Communication Tool**

I've added a powerful new tool to the AI agent that helps users understand each other!

**What it does:**
- Translates foreign language text
- Explains cultural context and meanings
- Detects misunderstandings
- Provides clear explanations
- Bridges language barriers

**How AI uses it:**
- Automatically triggered when foreign language is detected
- When users express confusion
- When communication breakdown occurs
- Proactively helps prevent misunderstandings

**Example usage:**
```
User A: "Ich spreche kein Englisch"
User B: "What did they say?"
AI: *uses clarify_communication tool*
AI: "They said 'I don't speak English' in German. 
     Would you like me to help translate your messages?"
```

---

### 2. 🔍 **Enhanced Translation Detection**

Added comprehensive logging to debug translation offers:

```javascript
// When message received:
[AI] Checking translation for incoming message: {
    isAIActive: true,
    messageUserId: "2",
    currentUserId: "1",
    isFromOtherUser: true,
    content: "Ich spreche Deutsch"
}
```

This will show us EXACTLY why translation offers do or don't appear.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Clarify Communication Tool (New!)

**Setup:** Two users in chat, AI On for both

**Scenario:**
1. **User A** types: "Bonjour, je ne comprends pas l'anglais"
2. **User B** sees the message
3. **User B** types: `/ai what did they say?`
4. **AI** uses `clarify_communication` tool
5. **AI** responds: "They said 'Hello, I don't understand English' in French..."

**Expected:**
- AI automatically uses the clarify tool
- Provides translation
- Explains context
- Suggests how to respond

---

### Test 2: Translation Detection Debug

**With console open** (F12):

1. **User A** sends: "Ich spreche Deutsch"
2. **User B** should see logs:
   ```
   [AI] Checking translation for incoming message: {...}
   [AI] Calling checkMessageForTranslation...
   [AI] Foreign language detected in message from: User A
   [AI] ✅ Translation offer shown
   ```

3. **If translation offer doesn't appear**, logs will show:
   ```
   [AI] Skipped translation check: {
       aiActive: false,  // <- AI is off
       isOwnMessage: true // <- Or it's your own message
   }
   ```

---

### Test 3: Real-World Communication

**Scenario: Language Barrier**

```
User A (German): "Hallo, sprechen Sie Deutsch?"
User B (English): *Clicks translation offer*
                  OR types: /ai translate that

AI: "They asked: 'Hello, do you speak German?'
     
     Would you like me to:
     1. Help you respond in German
     2. Continue translating their messages
     3. Suggest they use English"
```

## 🐛 Known Issues Being Debugged

### Issue: User Shown as Online After Logout

From your logs:
```
[Log] 📨 Received message: – {type: "user_left", ...}
[Log] 📨 Received message: – {type: "online_users", 
    users: [{user_id: "2", username: "human2", status: "online"}]}
```

**Problem:** User leaves but still shows as online

**This is a backend issue** - the WebSocket disconnect isn't properly removing the user from the online list. This needs to be fixed in the backend WebSocket handler.

**Quick fix:** Refresh the page to get updated online users list.
