- **Fix:** Corrected icon priority logic
- **File:** `PrivateRooms.js`

### **Bug 2: AI Toggle Functional** ✅
- **Issue:** Users could disable AI monitoring
- **Fix:** Force AI always on, disable toggle
- **File:** `chat.js`

### **Bug 3: Public Rooms Not Visible** ✅
- **Issue:** Public rooms only visible to members

- **File:** `data_manager.py`

---

## 🔒 Security Fixes

### **Security 1: Password Protection for Public Join** ✅
- **Vulnerability:** Bypass password on public room join
- **Fix:** Password validation in join endpoint
- **Protection:** Backend validates password before adding member

### **Security 2: Message Access Control** ✅
- **Vulnerability:** View messages without joining room
- **Fix:** Frontend blocks room selection if not member
- **Protection:** Backend already had `check_room_access()`

### **Security 3: Authorization Checks** ✅
- **What:** All endpoints validate membership/permissions
- **Where:** Delete (creator only), Messages (members only), Join (public only)
- **Result:** Multi-layer security (frontend + backend)
