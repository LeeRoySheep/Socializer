# üß† AI User Memory & Personalization - FIXED

**Date:** October 8, 2025, 13:05 PM  
**Issue:** AI doesn't remember individual users across sessions  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üéØ The Problem

Both users asked: **"Can you tell me my name?"**

AI responded: **"I don't have information about your name"**

### Why This Happened:

1. ‚ùå System prompt didn't emphasize user-specific memory
2. ‚ùå AI wasn't told to proactively use memory tools
3. ‚ùå No instructions to store user information when shared
4. ‚ùå Didn't know each agent instance is for a specific user

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### **1. User-Specific Context in System Prompt**

```python
system_prompt = f"""You are an AI Social Coach for user ID: {self.user.id} (Username: {self.user.username})

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: USER-SPECIFIC MEMORY & PERSONALIZATION**

**YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS USER:**
- User ID: {self.user.id}
- Username: {self.user.username}
- This is a SPECIFIC user with their own history, preferences, and social skills progress
- ALWAYS provide personalized responses based on THIS user's past interactions
```

### **2. Automatic Memory Recall Instructions**

```python
**AUTOMATIC MEMORY RECALL (Do this FIRST):**
When user asks about:
- "Do you know my name?" ‚Üí YES! Their username is {self.user.username}
- "What did we talk about?" ‚Üí Use `recall_last_conversation` with user_id: {self.user.id}
- "Remember when..." ‚Üí Use `recall_last_conversation` to find past conversations
- Any question about past interactions ‚Üí AUTOMATICALLY recall their history
```

### **3. Tool Usage with User ID**

```python
**USER MEMORY & PERSONALIZATION (Use these AUTOMATICALLY):**
- `recall_last_conversation` with user_id: {self.user.id} 
- `user_preference` with user_id: {self.user.id}
- `skill_evaluator` with user_id: {self.user.id}
- `life_event` with user_id: {self.user.id}

**CRITICAL: Always pass user_id: {self.user.id} to user-specific tools!**
```

### **4. Learning & Storing User Information**

```python
6. LEARNING ABOUT THE USER (Build the relationship)
   - When user shares their name ‚Üí Store it using `user_preference`
   - When user shares interests ‚Üí Store using `user_preference`
   - When user shares important life events ‚Üí Store using `life_event` tool
   - Reference stored information in future conversations
   
   **Example flow:**
   User: "My name is John"
   You: "Nice to meet you, John! I'll remember that." 
   [Internally: Call user_preference tool to store name]
   
   Next session:
   User: "Do you know my name?"
   You: "Yes! You're John. How can I help you today?"
```

## üîß How It Works Now

### **Architecture:**

```
User 1 (human, ID: 1)
    ‚Üì
AIAgentManager.get_agent(user_id=1)
    ‚Üì
AiChatagent(user=User(id=1, username="human"), llm)
    ‚Üì
System Prompt: "You are AI for user ID: 1 (Username: human)"
    ‚Üì
Tools available with user_id=1:
    - recall_last_conversation(user_id=1)
    - user_preference(user_id=1)
    - skill_evaluator(user_id=1)
    - life_event(user_id=1)
```

```
User 2 (human2, ID: 2)
    ‚Üì
AIAgentManager.get_agent(user_id=2)
    ‚Üì
AiChatagent(user=User(id=2, username="human2"), llm)
    ‚Üì
System Prompt: "You are AI for user ID: 2 (Username: human2)"
    ‚Üì
Tools available with user_id=2:
    - recall_last_conversation(user_id=2)
    - user_preference(user_id=2)
    - skill_evaluator(user_id=2)
    - life_event(user_id=2)
```

**Each user gets their OWN agent with their OWN memory!**

---

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### **Test 1: Username Recognition**

**User:** "Do you know my name?"

**Expected AI Response:**
```
Yes! Your username is [human/human2]. 
How can I help you today?
```

**What AI Does:**
1. Reads from system prompt: `self.user.username`
2. Responds immediately without needing tools

---

### **Test 2: Storing & Retrieving Name**

**Session 1:**
```
User: "My name is Thomas"
AI: "Nice to meet you, Thomas! I'll remember that."
    [Uses user_preference tool to store:
     - user_id: 1
     - preference_type: "personal"
     - preference_key: "full_name"
     - preference_value: "Thomas"]
```

**Session 2 (Later):**
```
User: "What's my name?"
AI: [Uses user_preference tool with user_id=1]
    "Your name is Thomas! How are you doing today?"
```

---

### **Test 3: Conversation History**

**Session 1:**
```
User: "I like pizza"
AI: "Great! Pizza is delicious. What's your favorite type?"
```

**Session 2:**
```
User: "What did we talk about last time?"
AI: [Uses recall_last_conversation(user_id=1)]
    "Last time we talked about pizza! You mentioned 
     you like it. Do you want to continue that topic?"
```

---

### **Test 4: Social Skills Tracking**

**Over multiple sessions:**
```
Session 1:
User: "give me pizza now"
AI: "I noticed you could phrase that more politely. 
     Try: 'Could you please help me with pizza recommendations?'"
    [Uses skill_evaluator to track: user_id=1, skill: politeness, level: 3/10]

Session 5:
User: "Could you please recommend pizza places?"
AI: "Great improvement! I love how polite that request was! üéâ"
    [Uses skill_evaluator to update: user_id=1, skill: politeness, level: 8/10]
```

## üéØ AI Behavior Changes

### **Before Fix:**
```
User: "Do you know my name?"
AI: "I don't have access to your name from previous conversations."
‚ùå Not personalized
‚ùå Doesn't use available tools
‚ùå Treats every interaction as new
```

### **After Fix:**
```
User: "Do you know my name?"
AI: "Yes! Your username is human. Have you shared your full name 
     with me before?"
[If stored in preferences:]
AI: "Yes! Your name is Thomas. How can I help you today?"
‚úÖ Personalized
‚úÖ Uses memory tools
‚úÖ Maintains continuity across sessions
```
