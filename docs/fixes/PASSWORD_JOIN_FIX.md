# üîí Password Protection for Public Room Join

**Issue:** Users could join password-protected public rooms without providing the password.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

---

## üêõ The Problem

When joining a public room via the "Join" button:
- Password check was missing from the `/join` endpoint
- Users could bypass password protection
- Security vulnerability for public-but-protected rooms

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### **Backend (`app/routers/rooms.py`):**

1. **Added request model:**
```python
class JoinRoomRequest(BaseModel):
    password: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Password if room is protected")
```

2. **Updated endpoint to validate password:**
```python
@router.post("/{room_id}/join")
async def join_public_room(room_id, request: JoinRoomRequest, current_user):
    # Get room
    room = dm.get_room(room_id)
    
    # Check if room has password
    if room.password:
        if not request.password:
            raise HTTPException(401, "This room is password-protected. Please provide the password.")
        
        if request.password != room.password:
            raise HTTPException(401, "Incorrect password. Please try again.")
        
        print(f"[TRACE] join_public_room: password validated")
    
    # Add user as member...
```

### **Frontend (`PrivateRooms.js`):**

1. **Updated `joinRoom()` to handle passwords:**
```javascript
async joinRoom(roomId, roomName, hasPassword = false, password = null) {
    // Prompt for password if needed
    if (hasPassword && !password) {
        password = prompt(`Enter password for "${roomName}":`);
        if (!password) return;  // User cancelled
    }
    
    // Send password in request body
    const body = hasPassword ? { password } : {};
    
    const response = await fetch(`${this.apiBaseUrl}/${roomId}/join`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { ... },
        body: JSON.stringify(body)
    });
    
    // Handle incorrect password
    if (response.status === 401 && error.detail.includes('password')) {
        this.showError(error.detail);
        if (confirm('Incorrect password. Try again?')) {
            return await this.joinRoom(roomId, roomName, hasPassword, null);
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Updated join button handler:**
```javascript
await this.joinRoom(room.id, room.name, room.has_password);
```
