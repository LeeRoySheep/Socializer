- **Markdown Docs:** 50+ (many redundant)
- **Test Files in Root:** 13 (should be in /tests)
- **Migration Scripts:** 10 (one-time use, completed)
- **Issues:** Poor organization, duplicate code, lack of docstrings

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Remove Obsolete Scripts [COMPLETED]

### **Migration Scripts (DELETED)**
These scripts were one-time fixes and are no longer needed:

- ✅ `fix_all_connection_leaks.py` - DELETED (Database connection leak fixes completed)
- ✅ `fix_all_remaining.py` - DELETED (Cleanup script completed)
- ✅ `fix_chat_rooms_migration.py` - DELETED (Database migration completed)
- ✅ `fix_indentation.py` - DELETED (Code formatting completed)
- ✅ `fix_leaks_batch.py` - DELETED (Batch leak fixes completed)

## 📈 Phase 5: Implement Observability Standards

### **Logging Framework**

```python
import logging
from typing import Any, Dict

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Standard log format:
# [TRACE] - Detailed flow tracking
# [DEBUG] - Development information
# [INFO] - Normal operations
# [WARN] - Potential issues
# [ERROR] - Errors that need attention
# [EVAL] - Evaluation/validation results

def log_operation(
    operation: str,
    user_id: int,
    success: bool,
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None
) -> None:
    """
    Standardized operation logging for O-T-E compliance.
    
    Args:
        operation: Name of the operation (e.g., 'create_room')
        user_id: User performing the operation
        success: Whether operation succeeded
        metadata: Additional context
    
    Observability:
        Logs to configured handler (file/console/external)
    
    Traceability:
        Includes user_id, timestamp, operation name
    
    Evaluation:
        Includes success status and validation results
    """
    log_data = {
        'operation': operation,
        'user_id': user_id,
        'success': success,
        'metadata': metadata or {}
    }
    
    if success:
        logger.info(f"[EVAL] {operation} succeeded: user_id={user_id}", extra=log_data)
    else:
        logger.error(f"[EVAL] {operation} failed: user_id={user_id}", extra=log_data)
```
