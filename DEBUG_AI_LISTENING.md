# üîç Debug Guide: AI Passive Listening

**Created:** October 8, 2025, 11:41 AM  
**Purpose:** Debug translation detection and suggestion clicking

---

## üéØ What We Fixed

### 1. Added Extensive Console Logging
Every step now logs to console so we can see exactly what's happening.

### 2. Improved Click Handling
- Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()`
- Added event capture mode
- Added try-catch for error handling
- Added keyboard support (Enter/Space)

### 3. Enhanced Translation Detection
- Lowered foreign language threshold: 10 chars ‚Üí **5 chars**
- More lenient keyword matching (removed word boundaries where needed)
- Better detection logging

### 4. Visual Improvements
- Thicker border (3px)
- Better hover effects
- Active state feedback
- Box shadow for depth

## üìä Console Output Guide

### When AI is Toggled On:
```javascript
[AI] Starting passive listening...
[AI] Passive listening active
```

### When You Type (each keystroke):
```javascript
[AI] Input changed: "h"
[AI] Input changed: "he"
[AI] Input changed: "hel"
[AI] Input changed: "help"
```

### When You Stop Typing (after 2 seconds):
```javascript
[AI] Analyzing text for suggestions: "help me please"
[AI] Detection results: {
  isQuestion: false,
  hasHelpKeywords: true,
  hasTranslateKeywords: false,
  hasNonAscii: false,
  likelyForeignLanguage: false,
  textLength: 15
}
[AI] Creating suggestion!
[AI] Suggestion element created
[AI] ‚úÖ Suggestion added to DOM and visible
```

### When You Click Suggestion:
```javascript
[AI] ‚úÖ Suggestion clicked! Captured text: "help me please"
[AI] Sending to handleAICommand...
[AI] Command sent successfully
[AI] Input cleared
[AI] Suggestion removed
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: No Console Logs When Typing

**Symptoms:**
- You type but see no `[AI] Input changed:` logs

**Causes:**
1. AI is not toggled on
2. Passive listening not started

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check in console:
isAIActive  // Should be: true
isListening // Should be: true

// Manually restart:
startPassiveListening()
```

---

### Problem 2: Detection Results All False

**Example Console:**
```javascript
[AI] Detection results: {
  isQuestion: false,
  hasHelpKeywords: false,
  hasTranslateKeywords: false,
  hasNonAscii: false,
  likelyForeignLanguage: false
}
[AI] ‚ùå No trigger matched - no suggestion created
```

**This means:**
- Text doesn't end with `?`
- No help keywords detected
- No translation keywords detected
- No foreign characters detected

**Test with these guaranteed triggers:**

1. **Question:**
   ```
   Type: "Hello there?"
   Should detect: isQuestion: true
   ```

2. **Help keywords:**
   ```
   Type: "can you help me"
   Should detect: hasHelpKeywords: true
   ```

3. **Translation keywords:**
   ```
   Type: "what does hello mean"
   Should detect: hasTranslateKeywords: true
   ```

4. **Foreign language:**
   ```
   Type: "Bonjour"
   Should detect: hasNonAscii: true
   ```

---

### Problem 3: Rate Limited

**Console Shows:**
```javascript
[AI] Rate limited, wait: 25 seconds
```

**This is normal!** Max 1 suggestion per 30 seconds.

**To reset:**
```javascript
// In console, run:
lastSuggestedHelp = 0
```

---

### Problem 4: Suggestion Not Clickable

**Checklist:**
1. Can you see the suggestion? ‚úÖ
2. Does cursor change to pointer on hover? ‚úÖ
3. Does it scale up on hover? ‚úÖ
4. When you click, do you see console logs? ‚ùå

**If no console logs when clicking:**

Try clicking again and check:
```javascript
// Should see:
[AI] ‚úÖ Suggestion clicked!
```

**If still nothing:**
1. Inspect element in DevTools
2. Check if click handler is attached
3. Try pressing Enter key while suggestion is focused

---

### Problem 5: Translation Not Detected

**Test these specific phrases:**

```javascript
// 1. Direct keyword
"translate this" 
// Should trigger: hasTranslateKeywords: true

// 2. Question pattern  
"what does bonjour mean"
// Should trigger: hasTranslateKeywords: true

// 3. Foreign text
"Bonjour comment allez-vous"
// Should trigger: likelyForeignLanguage: true

// 4. Mixed
"how do you say hello in Spanish"
// Should trigger: hasTranslateKeywords: true
```

---

## üìù Debug Commands

### Check Status:
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log({
    isAIActive,
    isListening,
    lastSuggestedHelp: new Date(lastSuggestedHelp).toLocaleTimeString()
})
```

### Manually Trigger Test:
```javascript
// Create a fake suggestion manually:
const input = document.getElementById('message-input');
input.value = "How do you say hello in French?";
input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
```

### Reset Rate Limit:
```javascript
lastSuggestedHelp = 0;
console.log('Rate limit reset');
```

### Force Suggestion:
```javascript
// This will show a test suggestion:
handlePassiveListening({ 
    target: { value: "How are you?" } 
});
```

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### Test 1: Simple Question
```
Input: "How are you?"
Wait: 2 seconds
‚úÖ Should see:
  - [AI] Analyzing text...
  - isQuestion: true
  - [AI] Creating suggestion!
  - Suggestion appears
  - Click works
```

### Test 2: Translation Request
```
Input: "translate hello to French"
Wait: 2 seconds
‚úÖ Should see:
  - hasTranslateKeywords: true
  - üåê icon in suggestion
  - "Need help with translation?"
  - Click works
```

### Test 3: Foreign Language
```
Input: "Bonjour"
Wait: 2 seconds
‚úÖ Should see:
  - hasNonAscii: true
  - likelyForeignLanguage: true
  - üåê icon
  - Click works
```

---

## üîß Manual Fix (If Nothing Works)

### Hard Reset:
```javascript
// In console:
stopPassiveListening();
isAIActive = false;
isListening = false;

// Then toggle AI off and on again in UI
```

### Verify Event Listener:
```javascript
// Check if listener is attached:
const input = document.getElementById('message-input');
console.log('Event listeners:', getEventListeners(input));
// Should show 'input' event with handlePassiveListening
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

1. **Typing shows logs:**
   ```
   [AI] Input changed: "..."
   ```

2. **After 2 seconds:**
   ```
   [AI] Analyzing text...
   [AI] Detection results: {...}
   ```

3. **Suggestion appears:**
   ```
   [AI] Creating suggestion!
   [AI] ‚úÖ Suggestion added to DOM
   ```

4. **Click works:**
   ```
   [AI] ‚úÖ Suggestion clicked!
   [AI] Command sent successfully
   ```

## üì∏ What You Should See

### Console Output Example:
```
[AI] Starting passive listening...
