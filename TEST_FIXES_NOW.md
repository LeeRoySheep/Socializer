## 🐛 If Something Fails

### **AI Toggle Still Works:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear localStorage: F12 → Application → Local Storage → Clear

### **Public Rooms Not Visible:**
- Check console logs: `[TRACE] get_user_rooms`
- Verify room has `is_public=true`:
  ```bash
  sqlite3 data.sqlite.db "SELECT id, name, is_public FROM chat_rooms;"
  ```

### **Join Button Missing:**
- Check console: `room.is_member` should be `false`
- Check API response includes `is_member` field
