"""
Migration: Add Room Visibility Field
=====================================

Adds 'is_public' field to chat_rooms table to distinguish between:
- Public rooms (discoverable, can be found by others)
- Hidden rooms (invite-only, not discoverable)

This enables invite-only rooms that don't need passwords since they're
not discoverable by uninvited users.
