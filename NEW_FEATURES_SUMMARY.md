# 🚀 New Features Implementation - 2025-10-15

**Status:** ✅ Ready to Test  
**Features:** Delete Room, Hidden Rooms, AI Monitoring  
**Standards:** TDD + OOP + O-T-E  

---

## 📋 Features Implemented

### **1. Delete Room (Creator Only)** ✅

**Feature:**
- Room creators can now delete their rooms
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Soft delete (marks `is_active=False`)
- Auto-refreshes room list after deletion

**Implementation:**

**Backend:**
- ✅ API endpoint already exists: `DELETE /api/rooms/{room_id}`
- ✅ Only creator can delete (authorization check)
- ✅ Soft delete implementation
- ✅ O-T-E logging

**Frontend:**
- ✅ Delete button (trash icon) appears for room creators only
- ✅ Confirmation dialog with room name
- ✅ Success/error toast notifications
- ✅ Room list refreshes after deletion
- ✅ Clears selection if active room was deleted

**Files Changed:**
- `static/js/chat/PrivateRooms.js` - Added `deleteRoom()` method, updated `createRoomElement()`

---

### **2. Hidden Rooms (Invite-Only)** ✅

**Feature:**
- Rooms are **hidden by default** (not discoverable)
- Optional "Make room discoverable" toggle for future public rooms
- Hidden rooms = invite-only (no password needed since uninvited users can't find them)
- Public rooms = discoverable (future feature for room directory)

**Business Logic:**
```
is_public = FALSE (Default)
  → Room is HIDDEN
  → Only invited users can access
  → Not discoverable by others
  → No password needed (privacy through obscurity + invite system)

is_public = TRUE
  → Room is PUBLIC
  → Can be discovered/searched (future feature)
  → May want password for extra protection
```

**Implementation:**

**Database:**
- ✅ Added `is_public` column to `chat_rooms` table
- ✅ Default: `FALSE` (hidden)
- ✅ Migration script: `migrations/add_room_visibility.py`

**Backend:**
- ✅ Updated `ChatRoom` model with `is_public` field
- ✅ Updated `create_room()` method to accept `is_public` parameter
- ✅ Updated API models (`RoomCreate`, `RoomResponse`)
- ✅ All endpoints return `is_public` status

**Frontend:**
- ✅ Added visibility toggle to create room modal
- ✅ Clear explanation of hidden vs public
- ✅ Icon indicator (🔐 for hidden, 👁️ for public)
- ✅ Default unchecked (hidden rooms)

**Files Changed:**
- `datamanager/data_model.py` - Added `is_public` field
- `datamanager/data_manager.py` - Updated `create_room()` method
- `app/routers/rooms.py` - Updated models and endpoints
- `templates/new-chat.html` - Added visibility toggle
- `static/js/chat/PrivateRooms.js` - Added `is_public` to room creation
- `migrations/add_room_visibility.py` - Database migration

---

### **3. AI Monitoring (Always Active)** ✅

**Feature:**
- AI is **ALWAYS enabled** in all rooms
- Monitors for:
  - Misunderstandings between users
  - Lack of empathy
  - Cultural and social context issues
  - Translation needs
  - Communication standards

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `ai_enabled` hardcoded to `True` in backend
- ✅ UI explains AI is always active for moderation
- ✅ Clear messaging about AI's role

**Already Working:**
- Backend enforces AI=True for all rooms
- Frontend displays explanation in create room modal
- AI monitoring is part of the existing chat system

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Run Migration**

```bash
# Activate venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run migration to add is_public column
python migrations/add_room_visibility.py

# Expected output:
# [TRACE] Starting room visibility migration...
# [TRACE] Adding is_public column...
# [EVAL] Column added successfully
# ✅ MIGRATION SUCCESS
```

---

### **Step 2: Start Server**

```bash
# Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Open browser
# http://localhost:8000/chat
```

---

### **Step 3: Test Delete Room**

**Test Flow:**
1. Login as User A
2. Create a new room (User A is creator)
3. Look for trash icon (🗑️) on the room
4. Click delete button
5. **Expected:** Confirmation dialog appears
6. Confirm deletion
7. **Expected:** Room disappears from list, success toast

**Test Creator-Only:**
1. User A creates room, invites User B
2. User B accepts invite
3. User B sees room in list
4. **Expected:** User B does NOT see delete button (not creator)

---

### **Step 4: Test Hidden Rooms**

**Test Default (Hidden):**
1. Create room with name "Secret Project"
2. Leave "Make room discoverable" **UNCHECKED**
3. Click Create
4. **Expected:** 
   - Room created with 🔐 icon (hidden)
   - `is_public=false` in API response
   - Eye-slash icon (👁️‍🗨️) displayed

**Test Public (Future):**
1. Create room with name "Public Discussion"
2. **CHECK** "Make room discoverable"
3. Click Create
4. **Expected:**
   - Room created with different icon
   - `is_public=true` in API response

---

### **Step 5: Test AI Monitoring**

**Verify AI Always Active:**
1. Create any room
2. **Expected:** Can't disable AI toggle
3. Check backend logs
4. **Expected:** `[TRACE] create_room: ... ai=True`

**Verify Explanation:**
1. Open create room modal
2. **Expected:** Blue info box explaining AI monitoring
3. Lists AI's responsibilities (empathy, misunderstandings, etc.)

## 🔍 Console Logs to Verify

### **Delete Room:**
```
[TRACE] deleteRoom: { room_id: X, name: "..." }
[EVAL] deleteRoom: cancelled by user  // if cancelled
[TRACE] deleteRoom: success
```

### **Create Hidden Room:**
```
[TRACE] handleCreateRoom: creating room {
  name: "...",
  has_password: false,
  ai_enabled: true,
  is_public: false,  // ✅ Default
  invites_count: 0
}
[TRACE] create_room: ... public=False
[TRACE] create_room success: room_id=X, members=2
```

### **Create Public Room:**
```
[TRACE] handleCreateRoom: creating room {
  ...
  is_public: true,  // ✅ When checked
  ...
}
[TRACE] create_room: ... public=True
```

## 💡 Design Decisions

### **Why Hidden by Default?**

1. **Privacy First:** Users expect private rooms to be truly private
2. **No Discovery Needed:** If uninvited users can't find the room, password is optional
3. **Simpler UX:** Most use cases are invite-only groups
4. **Future Proof:** Public rooms as opt-in feature for community/discovery

### **Why Delete Button for Creator Only?**

1. **Ownership:** Creator started the room
2. **Responsibility:** Creator should manage room lifecycle
3. **Security:** Prevents malicious members from destroying rooms
4. **Standard Pattern:** Common in chat apps (Discord, Slack, etc.)

### **Why AI Always On?**

1. **Core Feature:** Empathy monitoring is key value prop
2. **Safety:** Prevents toxic behavior
3. **Quality:** Improves communication standards
4. **Consistency:** All rooms have same moderation level
